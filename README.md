# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 2

***

This is the 2nd course project in the Getting and Cleaning Data Course. The purpose of the script,
run_analysis.R is the following:


1.  Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
5.  Creates a second, independent tidy data set (tidydata.txt) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
